# cuZK: An Efficient GPU Implemetation of zkSNARK

This library is an efficient GPU implemetation of zkSNARK. It contains source code of the paper **cuZK: Accelerating Zero-Knowledge Proof with A Faster Parallel Multi-Scalar Multiplication Algorithm on GPUs** published at TCHES 2023.

> Note: The contributions of this fork are:
> * improved reproducibility and scalability: using Docker for building, reduced memory footprint, tested various GPUs 
> * introduced profiling of time/energy performance

## License

This library is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0 and MIT licenses.

## Requirements

To compile and run the code you **only need a GPU with NVIDIA drivers installed**; the CUDA Toolkit with compiling and runtime tools will be supplied by Docker.

The original experiments were accompolished in the following setup:

1. Ubuntu 20.04
2. CUDA 11.5
3. gcc 7.5.0
4. Nvidia V100 (32 GB)


## Build / Develop

The [Docker image](./Dockerfile) provides the necessary software by extending the appropriate [NVIDIA CUDA image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags). Build it with
```bash
docker build -t cuzk:dev .
```
Then, start the container mounting the repo directory:
```console
docker run -d \
   -it \
   --name cuzk \
   --runtime=nvidia \
   --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/home \
   --privileged \
   cuzk:dev
```
and enter the container (e.g. with the VS Code plugin or via the command line `docker exec -it -w /home cuzk bash`).

Inside the `cuZK/test` directory, adjust the compilation scope in the headers of `Makefile`:
```Makefile
# cuZK/test/Makefile
all: msmb  # limit the compilation scope to selected files
```
and then run `make` (it will take a while!)
```console
root@3ed8c7a4de3e:/home/test# make
...
```
Finally, run the benchmark (adjust the output file and (optionally) the logic inside the script)
```console
./energy_benchmark.sh
...
```


> NOTE:  See also more on [compute capability](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capability) in [the documentation](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute).

> NOTE: The original code reserves too much of RAM. This can be adjusted inside the function `multi_init_params`.

## Profiling

Advanced profiling can be done with [NVIDIA Management Library](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml). 
The querying API should be used around the code piece of interest; the example below measures the energy consumption:
```cpp
   nvmlInit();
   unsigned long long energy_start, energy_end, energy_elapsed;
   nvmlDeviceGetTotalEnergyConsumption(device, &energy_start);
   // code to profile ...
   nvmlDeviceGetTotalEnergyConsumption(device, &energy_end);
   energy_elapsed = energy_end - energy_start;
   nvmlShutdown();
```
The `nvml` library should be included in the source code with `#include <nvml.h>` and linked at compilation time with `-l nvidia-ml` option.

Performance depends on the clock frequency; the range of allowed frequencies can be checked with `nvidia-smi -q -d SUPPORTED_CLOCKS`
and the memory/graphics clocks can be adjusted with `nvidia-smi -ac $mem,$freq`. 

See the [script profiling the MSM algorithm under a range of frequencies](./test/energy_benchmark.sh), and a [sample Python script to process results](./test/energy_benchmark.py).


 Here are results obtained on Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB:

## Run Original Code

To run a test of an MSM of `2^20` scale and EC points on the BLS12-381 curve, run:
```
## (It will take some time to run for the first time.)
./msmtestb 20 
```

To run a test of Groth protocol with `2^20` constraint scales and EC points on the BLS12-381 curve, run:
```
## (It will take some time to run for the first time.)
./testb 20
```

For EC points on the ALT_BN128 curve and MNT4, run:
```
## ALT_BN128
./msmtesta 20
./testb 20

## MNT4
./msmtestm 20
./testm 20
```

In addition, our BLS12-377 carve implementation has a Rust binding with the template from [Sppark](https://github.com/supranational/sppark) developed by Supranational LLC. To install the latest version of Rust, first install rustup. Once rustup is installed, install the Rust toolchain by invoking:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable
```

To test BLS12-377 carve implementation.
```
cd test/BLS377
cargo bench
```
